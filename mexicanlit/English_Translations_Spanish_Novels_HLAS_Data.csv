Not received seriously by some critics, in fact, the theme of the passage of one consciousness through two (or many) bodies is a constant throughout Fuentes' writing. The author conceives of this novel as one of a trilogy completed by {lcub}Birthday{rcub} and {lcub}Distant Relations{rcub}. A very good translation."

Though Alfred J. MacAdam believes that the novel is dated, it has, in fact, weathered well, and will continue to be studied as ""a philosophical manifesto, a revolt against literary language, and the account of an extraordinary spiritual pilgrimage,"" as it has been classified by Luis Harss. The translation, as indicated, is similarly a milestone in Spanish American literature."

Arguedas was one of those writers, like Asturias, like Aguilera Malta, who invented a language that was neither Spanish nor Indian. In his informative introduction, ethnohistorian Murra sketches some of the intricacies of this creation. And adds, parenthetically in a footnote, that ""no one has yet undertaken to translate Arguedas into Spanish."" Vargas Llosa's afterword offers to the reader who may not be familiar with Arguedas an illuminating discussion of the author's world: ""One could say of a novel so cleverly autobiographical that Arguedas has transplanted his own trials into the narrative in a symbolic fashion.""

The dream is crucial, if ultimately unresolved as to meaning.

In some respects there are improvements (we are not, for example, submitted to the apellation ""Blondie"" for the Güero Margarito), but some of the very specific and difficult problems of this text have not been resolved.

Schemes... is a comic, yet brutal attack on negative influences of North American capitalist consumerism on a society whose economy does not afford the majority of its people a decent living, let alone the joys of conspicuous consumption. Protagonist is also victim of very problems he attacks - too cosmopolitan to revert to provincialism, and yet too aware of evils of his sophistication to profit from it. Novel's language is difficult, laced with puns and satire, often bilingual. Translation - though conceded to be difficult - does not do justice to the original, especially in dialogue. Exaggerated adherence to Spanish structure and rhetorical level, creates English effect not representative of Spanish text. Great sense of linguistic play is necessary for such a translation; unfortunately this difficult task is not achieved."

Relies heavily on signs of various typefaces, so it is essential that they be carried over into the translation. This is effectively accomplished in the English version. Some footnotes have a different spatial arrangement, which is somewhat disorienting, but they are there. Colchie has a good ear for this very oral prose, and produces necessary contrast in official and semiofficial reports.

",Deanna Heikkinen ,New York,Farrar  Straus  and Giroux ,2001,"The long-awaited English translation of Poniatowska's classic novel {Hasta no verte, Jesús mío} (see {HLAS 42:5206}) based on testimony of Josefina Bórquez that author tape recorded and recreated as a ""testimonial novel."" First-person voice of fictional Jesusa Palancares, an indomitable rebel, narrates her adventures as {soldadera} in the army of General Carranza during the Mexican Revolution, and her violent hardscrabble life as a domestic, factory worker, and member of a spiritualist cult, in feisty vernacular of Mexican popular speech. While her insights reveal both the Revolution's failure to live up to its promises and the brutal life of poor women in 20th-century Mexico, Bórquez never loses her extraordinary sense of humor and humanity. Publication of this unique combination of testimony and fiction marked a profound change in modern Mexican literature and became Poniatowska's hallmark in {Massacre in Mexico} ({La noche de Tlatelolco} see {HLAS 35:7533}); {Nothing, nobody: voices of the Mexican earthquake} (see {HLAS 52:3495} and {HLAS 56:4613}); and the novels that recreate women's lives: {Dear Diego} ({HLAS 42:5207} and {HLAS 50:4283}) and {Tinísima} ({HLAS 54:3727} and {HLAS 58:4648}). Author's introductory memoir about her relationship with Bórquez and production of fictionalized testimony offer important insights into one of the most important novels of modern Mexico. Heikkinen's translation retains tough orality of Spanish originals and conserves a sprinkling of Mexican phrases that re-enforce sounds of revolution and survival.

Santo Domingo 1977). Practically since the publication of the Spanish-edition of this first novel, Rita Indiana became an outstanding figure in contemporary Latin American and Caribbean letters. She is known for her fast-paced, spoken-word-style filled with music, street speech, and pop culture references. The coming-of-age novel is a first-person portrait of the inner-life of the narrator, the eight-year-old daughter of an absent father. While he is away and living a gangster-life-style, she waits - for days, months, maybe years - and tells imagined stories of her dad's soon-to-happen triumphant returns with wealth and gifts. The girl ""repeats 'Papi' like a mantra, spell, or rosary. His name takes on a supernatural power; it represents his daughter's immense belief in him no matter the length of his absences [...] Papi's invincibility is a blanket of comfort and denial for the narrator, as she is unable to demonize Papi no matter what promises or laws he breaks"" (Marilyse V. Figueroa review {World Literature Today}, November 2016). In her narrative of her idolized father, he is both ""larger than life"" and ""cocky and brash"" [...] ""Although the child clearly loves her dad and is thrilled to be part of his entourage, she has also had to reckon with the fact that Papi can be irresponsible, conniving, and cutthroat. Furthermore, she knows that he treats women badly and has herself been on the receiving end of his broken promises and blatant lies"" ({Kirkus} review, March 22 2016). In her poignant novels, Indiana is able to tackle gender, class, and racial inequalities with sharpness, humour and wit. As she does in {Nombres y animales} (2013) and {La mucama de Omicunlé} (2015), in {Papi} she takes on, without romanticism and with dark humour and her characteristic vertiginous mix of registers and genres, the world and subjectivity of women in a patriarchal society and the violence of the intimate space.

Part of a novel series (which includes {El fondo del cielo}, and {La parte recordada}) and referencing Canciones Tristes, an imaginary city that appears recurrently in Fresán's works, this novel - labelled psychological fiction - is a metafictional narrative about writing, literary culture, and being a writer. It centers around the mind and world of an aging, disillusioned writer - Fresán's alter ego - and his existential diatribes and anxieties as he tries to write his own story. It is ""literature set in the process of dying and someone who continues to write so as to postpone death"" ({El cultural}, 7 August 2018). Fresán blends memory with Western music and literature - in the form of a soundtrack and a library - in a fragmented, digressive, and ""kaleidoscopic"" style. Enrique Vila Matas described the novel's prose as written for readers from a different, past time, the good old times when a writer could just keep writing, perfecting a style and a voice (Vila Matas, ""Una vida de ventrílocuo"", {El País}, 11 March 2014).

Hans Ertl was a Bavarian who served as Leni Riefenstahl's cameraman and Rommel's photographer before fleeing to Bolivia with his family after the Second World War. His daughter Monika would later join left-wing guerillas and may have assassinated the military leader responsible for ordering Che Guevara's execution before she herself was killed by Bolivian forces. ""The brilliance of this novel is rooted in its narrative, which is told from multiple perspectives,"" writes the {Literary Review} (20 Nov. 2017), each chapter narrated by a different character, principally Ertl's daughters. Hans lords over his family in Bolivia with the bombastic fantasies one might expect from a former Nazi - he sets off with two of his daughters in search of a lost city of gold, like ""Werner Herzog's Fitzcarraldo: courageous and determined, but also irrational, constantly misled, devoid of support and blind to everything but his desire to fulfill his project,"" as {Words Without Borders} (Sept. 2017) puts it. {Kirkus Reviews} (1 Aug. 2017) characterizes this short ""brisk, sensitive US debut"" as galloping ""across a half-century's worth of transformations in Bolivia, and sections narrated by individual characters are marked by a surprising depth of emotional detail given the story's brevity.""

Centering around the Buenos Aires academic milieu and entwined with the thinking of various theorists and authors, from Wittgenstein to Bolaño, the novel follows Rosa Ostreech's life as a graduate student, from her sex life to her readings and struggles with writing her thesis. Told in parallel are the stories of a Dutch anthropologist doing research in Africa, and a series of characters exploring the underground scene of Buenos Aires. The novel has been critically acclaimed in Argentina and abroad, mainly for its theme and use of language: ""Dark and humorous in turns, the tone is wry, erudite, raunchy, and the text is sprinkled with references to politics, philosophy, anthropology, and pop culture and the occasional illustration. Academic posturing is mocked [...] While there are echoes of Borges and Bolaño here, the synthesis of ideas and the manic intelligence are wholly new"" ({Kirkus Reviews}, 10 Jan. 2017). Of the translation, David Varno notes that, ""the perversions of language is one of Oloixarac's central themes, and this, along with the nuanced references to Argentina's Dirty War and the country's political history following Peronism, plus the characters' tenuous interpretations of various philosophers expressed in murky academic syntax, must have made the book particularly challenging to translate. Roy Kesey succeeded in creating a text that is immersive, multilayered, sensual, and cerebral, and it captures Oloixarac's wicked brand of humor, which often triggers bark-like laughs followed by pangs of guilt"" ({Words Without Borders}, January 2017).

An author of fiction and non-fiction and considered by many Cuba's best living writer, Padura is known for his detective novel series and, most recently, for the historical fiction master work {The Man Who Loved Dogs} (see {HLAS 70:2292}). Combining historical and detective fiction, {Heretics} narrates events surrounding the experience of Jewish refugee families in Havana during and after WWII. It centers on the disappearance of a Rembrandt painting - a portrait of Christ - brought to Cuba by one of the families travelling on the {S.S. Saint Louis} in 1939 to seek asylum in Cuba, and the search for it by Elías, son of Daniel Kaminsky and one of the relatives who succeeded in settling in Cuba. For this search, he hires detective Mario Conde, protagonist of several of Padura's novels, who aids Kaminsky in the search throughout Cuba and all the way to an auction house in London. This handsome hardcover edition of the over 500-page work is described as an epic novel and also as ""the story of modern Havana, a lost family history, and the origins of a notorious painting.""

That relationship is at the heart of the three-volume {Diarios} of his long-standing fictional alter ego Emilio Renzi - who is also the detective in some of Piglia's novels. Piglia wrote this first volume, ""Formative years"", corresponding to the period between 1957 and 1967 in the first and third person in a span of almost 60 years - until 2015. Taken from 327 notebooks, the volume includes everyday notes, quotations, comments on writing, literary life and the print media world, and include interspersed pieces of fiction and non-fiction. Their overall autobiographical narrative - chiefly a literary life - tells of coming of age, family, reading, writing, and life in Argentina, and Latin America. It features references and close-reading notes to countless authors, from Borges, Onetti, and Cortázar to Beckett and Pirandello, and, as in Piglia's oeuvre, fiction and non-fiction blend with history and politics: ""In Argentine history,"" Piglia once wrote, ""politics and fiction...are two simultaneously irreconcilable and symmetrical universes"" and literature ""maintains coded relationships with the machinations of power.""

The coming-of-age, autobiographical fictional narrative weaves fiction, memoir, and essay for a beautiful, poignant exploration of love and death. It opens with the protagonist, Julián, sitting at his sick mother's bedside as she is dying in a hospital in northern Mexico. The narrator begins to remember his childhood and youth, as the single child of the prostitute Guadalupe, growing up in brothels in this tough community, with half brothers and sisters from a different father, and then going from city to city. The protagonist Julián's stories alternate between the past and the present as, while pacing around the hospital, he narrates his life as a writer in today's Mexico. Herbert's style is enthralling, as noted in the numerous reviews praising the novel and its translation. ""From its pathos-filled prologue to its poignant closing lines, Herbert's novel is shot through with fury and filial love. This sounds bleak - it isn't. Indeed, it is one of the novel's characteristics that it is able to swing from heartbreak to grisly humor within a few lines."" (Ángel Gurría Quintana, {Words Without Borders}, April 2018). Born in Acapulco, Herbert is known for his poetry, essays, short stories, and now as a novelist. He has also translated poetry from English.

The novel is structured as three stories within three distinct time frames. The first one, set in the future, centers on the life of Acilde Figueroa, a young queer maid living in Santo Domingo. We follow Alcide's life of sex, friendships, and struggle on the harsh streets of Santo Domingo. Acilde finds herself at the heart of a Santería apocaliptic prophecy to save the ocean after a nuclear disaster, and ends up working for an elderly voodoo spiritual leader linked to the government. Acilde, who passes as a boy, is saving up to be able to undergo a gender reassignment operation. ""A dry, sardonic tone anchors the pulpy narrative, with its bloody violence, brutish sex and futuristic flourishes, all seasoned with bitter humour and a hint of the occult. The second time frame, roughly approximating our own era, focuses on pretentious art students dreaming up performance pieces. The third, set in the Spanish Main, introduces a group of sinister, quarrelling pirates (Suzi Feay. ""{Tentacle} by Rita Indiana review - a post-apocalyptic odyssey"" {The Guardian}, January 2019). Told in the brilliant, fast-paced narrative that characterizes Indiana's writing, the novel takes on climate change, technology, AfroCaribbean spirituality, queer and culture politics, poverty, and colonialism.

In this case, Monge opted to put in italics the verbatim accounts he took from Central American migrants crossing Mexico, as well as citations from Dante's {Inferno}. Frank Wynne, the translator, made the wise decision to preserve the Spanish names of the main characters, Epitafio (""Epitaph"") and Estela (""Gravestone""), thus retaining a certain Spanish lyricism instead of an awkward surrender to English. The eruption of documentary voices of the migrants makes the text feel visceral and immediate - a human rights document. At the same time, the author has said that these voices are intended to act as a Greek Chorus, with other allusions to Greek tragedies and to Dante throughout. The corrupt, exploitative protagonists act as a ""much more malevolent Virgil"" in the words of the author. Monge, ""From my point of view, when a migrant leaves their country and begins the journey, what they're doing is descending into hell. They lose aspects of their identity, their personality, their voice, sometimes their language, their religion, and, above all, their individuality."" {The Guardian} (25 Nov. 2018) comments, ""Stylistically reminiscent of an earlier Mexican master Juan Rulfo, and with nods to both Chilean maverick Roberto Bolaño, and fellow Mexicans Alvaro Enrique and Yuri Herrera, Monge's realist, deadly topical fiction is a weighty metaphor for our world gone mad.""

From their alternating narratives, which foreground their pathos, the reader can see that both Claudio and Cecilia experience the city in its fullness, while knowing they are outsiders and meditating on their sense of alienation within a grim existence.

The three volume {Diaries} recount the life and thoughts of Emilio Renzi, Piglia's alter ego, a figure that emerged as the detective protagonist in his 1967 short story collection {The Invasion}. The opening section titled ""In the bar,"" a meditation on time and writing, reads: ""A life is not divided into chapters, Emilio Renzi said to the bartender of El Cervantillo that afternoon, leaning on the bar, standing before the mirror and the bottles of whiskey, vodka, and tequila lined up on the shelves. I've always been intrigued by the unreal yet mathematical way we organize the days, he said. Take the almanac, a senseless prison on experience that imposes a chronological order onto a period of time that flows without criteria"" (p. 3). {The Happy Years} covers Renzi's ""diaries"" from 1968 to 1975, the beginning of the author's literary career. Renzi recounts his work in a magazine, as editor and publisher, his meetings with several writers including Borges, Puig, Roa Bastos, and Piñera. Piglia's Renzi diaries are a record of a time in political and literary history, they are centrally about writing, the world and scenes of literature, and books. In the comprehensive review article ""The Act of Recounting,"" which describes Piglia against the political backdrop of Argentina he and his family lived through, Jessica Loudis describes how the surrounding circumstances made their way into Piglia's writing style: ""The temptation to read Piglia's books as straightforward journals - despite the author's insistence on treating them as fiction - can occasionally be maddening, as if their readers have been unwittingly enlisted in a postmodern game. And indeed we have, though much more is at stake. As Piglia witnessed the dissolution of Argentine society under a series of repressive governments, he sought new models of writing and representing reality. In metafiction, he found a means to subvert the conformity and censorship that flourished under these regimes [...] He told an interviewer that 'political contexts define ways of reading.' Through indirection and other literary techniques, Piglia revealed the frightening mechanisms of state power that had subjugated Argentina and the ways in which they might be resisted."" (J Loudis, ""The Act of Recounting."" {The Nation}, Feb. 17, 2020). Piglia (Buenos Aires, 1940-2017), was a professor at Princeton, and is considered one of contemporary Spanish-language's most important and influential writers. He published five novels, including {Artificial Respiration, The Absent City,} and {Target in the Night}, as well as collections of stories and criticism.

Partly based on Rivera's own travels, the narrative is structured as Cova's diary, found after his disappearance, which is then transcribed to be submitted to the Minister of Foreign Relations.

Author Freddy Prestol Castillo (b. 1914) was an eyewitness and unwilling accomplice as a rural magistrate during the dictatorship of Trujillo, who throughout the 1930s was consolidating power in part through an appeal to a racist nationalism that scapegoated Haitians. {El masacre se pasa a pie} mixes autobiography and fiction. The narrator moves from his own life trajectory from the city to the scene of the massacre, and then introduces narrative elements of the brutal killings, sexual violence, and ethnic cleansing. The acclaimed activist, writer, and translator Margaret Randall tries to capture the significant shifts in register from the formal declarative tone at the autobiographical beginning to the increasingly feverish descriptions in the book's extended middle narrative section as well as the many non-standard versions of Spanish that the characters speak. A brief but crucial foreword by scholar María Cristina Fumagalli sketches in the social and political context of the massacre and also gives the reader the tools to navigate the text's contradictory elements, such as Castillo's obvious horror at the slaughter as well as his occasional reliance on tropes of race and class in depicting the Haitians. Fumagalli also traces the manuscript's strange provenance: written during and after the massacre, Castillo hid the manuscript with his mother during the totalitarian regime of Trujillo. His sister buried it to protect it, but when the author dug it up, it had partially rotted away so Castillo was forced to reconstruct parts of it. Finally published in 1973 in Spanish, it was only released in English in 2019. Julia Alvarez calls this a ""key text in understanding the thirty-one-year dictatorship of Trujillo.""

David Toscana (b. 1961, Monterrey, Mexico) received the 2017 Xavier Villaurrutia Award for his novel {Olegaroy}. Three of his novels have previously been translated into English. Before his death in June 2020, translator David William Foster, was a distinguished scholar of LGBT, women's writings and Jewish themes in Latin American literature. He contributed enormously to the diversification of Latin American literary studies. [JMP]"
https://lccn.loc.gov/bi2021000719,"Melchor, Fernanda ",Mexico,Hurricane season ,Sophie Hughes ,London,Fitzcarraldo Editions ,2020,"A welcome translation of the critically acclaimed {Temporada de huracanes} (2017), this is the first book by contemporary Mexican author Fernanda Melchor (b. 1982) to appear in English. In a masterful, vertiginous prose, the novel tells a story of a murder in a village, La Matosa, where a group of children find a woman's decomposing corpse; through the mystery surrounding the death of the woman, a transgender daughter of another woman known as The Witch, Melchor paints a portrait of Mexico. Adding to the quality of the writing, the value of this novel and its translation into English also resides in its foregrounding the crisis and epidemic of murdered and missing women in Mexico and across Latin America today. As Lucas Iberico Lozada's review in {The Nation} (9 July 2020) notes, ""Activists across Latin America have been sounding the alarm about femicide since at least the mid-1990s. In the past few years, however, the #NiUnaMenos movement (from the phrase {Ni una mujer menos, ni una muerta más} - ""Not one woman less, not one more death"") has increased in urgency as violence against women has reached staggering figures in the Americas."" Activists across Latin America have been sounding the alarm about femicide since at least the mid-1990s"" and the #NiUnaMenos movement ""has increased in urgency as violence against women has reached staggering figures in the Americas. In Mexico, the UN now estimates that 10 women were killed each day in 2019, up from seven per day in 2017."" Although there are numerous journalistic and fiction narratives taking on this subject, Melchor's voice is unique. ""There is no peace to be found in {Hurricane Season}, no relief afforded the reader, no happy ending for the survivors. What Melchor offers instead is [...] not catharsis but vengeance"" [...] Speaking after the publication of {Hurricane Season} ""Melchor described literature as trench warfare: If the newspapers insisted on describing men who kill women as aberrant monsters, transformed by love into something evil, she would write a book revealing the everyday monstrousness of violence"" (Iberico Lozada, {op cit.}) Melchor is recognized among the most dynamic new voices of Mexican literature today. She won the PEN Mexico Award for Literary and Journalistic Excellence in 2018 and the German Anna-Seghers-Preis and the International Literature Award in 2019. The book and Sophie Hughes's translation have received praise; Hugues has translated several contemporary Latin American and Spanish novels; her translation of Alia Trabucco Zerán's {The Remainder} was shortlisted for the 2019 Man Booker International Prize. A new edition of {Hurricane Season} will be issued by New Directions. [MCG]"
https://lccn.loc.gov/bi2021000721,"Quintana, Pilar ",Colombia,The bitch ,Lisa Dillman,New York,World Editions ,2020,"This is a beautiful translation of the poignant, uncompromising novel {La perra}, by Colombian Pilar Quintana (b. 1972), which has been a literary sensation and received national and international critical acclaim. Set on the Colombian Pacific coast, where socioeconomic realities are rough and the humid jungle combined with the intensity of the ocean create an extreme natural environment for its inhabitants, the novel centers on the life of Damaris, a young, working-class woman who lives with her fisherman husband in a humble house on a seaside bluff. One of the threads of the narrative revolves around the relationship between Damaris and an orphaned puppy, ""the bitch,"" which she adopts. Damaris is struggling herself as she tries to become pregnant. Quintana's novel is an exploration and an unromaticized meditation on woman - and motherhood, class, love, and freedom. The prose, plain and powerful, seems to stand on the tense, fragile balance of nature and of human existence as they are enacted in the novel. The first work by Quintana to be translated into English, {The Bitch} won the Colombian Biblioteca de Narrativa Prize and was selected for several Best Books of 2017 lists, as well as being chosen as one of the most valuable objects to preserve for future generations in a time capsule in Bogotá. It won the English Pen Award and was finalist for the 2020 National Book Award for Translated Literature. One of the National Book Award judges stated: ""{The Bitch} distills entire social, ethical, and cultural universes into a potent short novel, thanks to Pilar Quintana's remarkable eye for detail and Lisa Dillman's spare yet stirring translation. Set in a coastal town in Colombia, this novel is populated by complex characters outlined with minimalist strokes of absolute precision, and offers a startling, profound portrait of frustrated desire that will stay with the reader for a long time to come."" Contemporary Mexican writer Yuri Herrera describes how {La perra} ""uncovers wounds we didn't know we had, shows us their beauty, and then throws a handful of salt into them."" Other works by Quitana are {Cosquillas en la lengua, Coleccionistas de polvos raros, Caperucita se come al lobo}, and her most recent novel {Los abismos.} Lisa Dillman translates Spanish, Catalan, and Latin American writers and teaches at Emory University. Among her many translations are {Such Small Hands} by Andrés Barba, winner of the 2018 Oxford-Weidenfeld Translation Award, and {Signs Preceding the End of the World} and {The Transmigration of Bodies} by Yuri Herrera, respectively awarded the Best Translated Book Award (2017) and the Dublin Literary Award (2018).
