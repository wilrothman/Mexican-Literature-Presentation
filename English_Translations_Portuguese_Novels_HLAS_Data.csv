It is a typical Coelho narrative, strong on spiritual yearning and magic, weak on prose, as it recounts the story of the spiritual journey of an Irish girl who realizes she has been a witch for centuries. A story of reincarnation and witchcraft, of seeking and finding love and letting go. Coelho tries to add significance to his words by capitalizing certain nouns - Love, Tradition, Sun, Moon - to no avail. His vocabulary is simplistic and unvarnished; his images obvious and undemanding; his syntax simple and his message plain. Despite Costa's valiant effort, this book will still appeal to his many fans and alienate those who expect better writing and thinking. Coelho avoids subordinate clauses, and insists on a paratactic style that is easy to read and to digest, always focused on the simple message, not on the delivery. Costa improves the register - no longer Coelho's impatient basic functional prose. A simple philosophy in simple sentences - that is the essence of Paulo Coelho, and the translator's task is not to interfere, while adding a touch of grace to his prose, and in this she succeeds by fleshing out his schematic and hasty prose.  Where Coelho's sentences are truncated and his language unpolished, Costa has added enough embellishment to improve on his style, which is bare without being attractive. [DP]"

In the tradition of Ovid, Boccaccio, and Chaucer, the novel presents a kaleidoscopic series of stories told by a group of migrant workers who have signed up to live and work for two years in a Brazilian mine deep below the ground, excavating some mysterious and lethal substance. In this setting, the workers spin their tales into a complex and uncanny narrative of love, rage, hope, terror, magic, and most everything else. The narrative deploys an unusual and inventive blend of oral and literary language that incorporates extensive allusions to popular culture, literary classics, mythology, and biblical and many other elements to recreate the imaginary world of the characters. A challenge for any translator, the book inspired Sotelino to create an original nonstandard dialect in English (with help from Mark Twain's {Huckleberry Finn}), which succeeds in avoiding both the tics of regionalism and linguistic condescension.

Bom Fim is the neighborhood in the city of Porto Alegre in which Scliar grew up. Populated by Jewish immigrants who went to the south of Brazil in the late 1920s, it is the setting for many of Scliar's works. Mingling history with fantasy, Scliar tells the story of a war pitting the Jewish children of Bom Fim against German invaders. Set in the 1940s, the local fantasy war in Bom Fim contrasts with the very different problems faced by the community's adults, as well as with the real war against the Jews unfolding in Europe. Virtually all Scliar's subsequent themes appear in this work, which offers a detailed portrait of everyday life in this Jewish enclave during WWII. It also demonstrates Scliar's characteristic immersion in the folklore and legends of the Jews, in Jewish humor and tragedy, and in the fascinating mixture of Jewish culture with that of Brazil's other immigrant and indigenous groups.

Zélia Gattai Amado explains in a brief postscript that years ago her husband had discarded numerous pages from the novel ({Tocaia Grande}, 1984 - see {HLAS 50:3920}; published in English as {Showdown} in 1988 - see {HLAS 52:5033}) he was working on at the time.

Saramago's brief foreword celebrates the ""joy of Brazil"" that for decades was Amado's real theme and praises Amado's work as a mirror and portrait of the entire Brazilian people.

About to be reappropriated by his stodgy family, in a final victory of pleasure over bourgeois values, Quincas is spirited away by his drinking buddies, who take him on a last and unforgettable blowout.

Hastings,New York,Other Press ,2014,"Ribeiro, himself a diplomat as well as a journalist, won Brazil's PEN Prize for Best Novel in 2011 with this book, which follows the career of a diplomat who, as a young man, allies himself with the Brazilian military after the 1964 coup. An unnamed narrator tells the story of his colleague, Max, whom he first meets at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs where both are working in 1968, the year in which the military rulers of Brazil suspended political and civil rights and tightened their control over Brazilian society and its institutions. While managing to keep his hands clean technically, Max passes through embassies of various Latin American countries under military control, in a startling and cool portrait of the world of official diplomacy during a violent period in Latin America's history. As a psychological portrait that unfolds slowly, the novel is reminiscent of Moravia's {lcub}The Conformist{rcub}. Kim Hastings provides a sophisticated translation that reads beautifully and fully conveys the fascination of the original. [DP]"

For his work as a whole, Rodrigues received the 2011 Prêmio Cultura do Estado do Rio de Janeiro for Literature. This fascinating book, originally published in Brazil in 2009, is another example of the current vogue in contemporary Brazilian literature for novels that mix the political thriller with historical fiction. In this case, Xerxes, a 90-year-old former communist, hires a journalist to write his life story and research a long-ago episode involving a young girl code-named Elza. Elza Fernandes was an actual historical figure whose execution in 1935 was ordered by Luiz Carlos Prestes, then head of the Brazilian Communist Party.

In a prolix style that ceaselessly suggests connections between the most disparate things, and using the regionalisms of colloquial Brazilian Portuguese, the novel spans decades and continents while focusing on the problems facing Brazil's indigenous people; in particular, the gap between the very different worlds inhabited by the dispossessed indigenous peoples of Brazil, represented in the novel by the girl Maína, and the urban upper middle-class represented by the novel's protagonist, Paulo.

The narrator, Tato Simmone, is an unhappy young painter living in Curitiba who is trying to deal with the death of his best friend and mentor. Engaged in a correspondence with a mysterious woman living in Italy, Tato also becomes involved with a local woman referred to only as ""the vampire."" The plot centers around a sculpture (perhaps a fake) by Modigliani that all the principals in Tato's life are eager to get their hands on. As he becomes more immersed in the mysteries surrounding him, Tato ruminates on art and life. Alan R.

It narrates the formative years of Pompeia's alter ego, Sérgio, as a student at the famous boarding school, the Athenaeum, with its purported modern education. Written in 1888, the novel is also known for its scathing satire, in which some see an allegory of the wider world of Brazilian institutions, the last days of the Brazilian Empire and the social and political upheavals that followed. Pompeia's style, with its baroque imagery, his masterful grip of rhetorical devices, and his immense vocabulary, demands a lot of translators. Pompeia presents readers with a miniature Rabelaisian world. It is a good to see the book translated, but more translations would be welcome given the many  layers to be explored in the book: parody, satire, humor. The volume's introduction is titled: ""Darwinism, Max Norday and Raul Pompeia's Struggle for Existence."" The book also offers a translator's note at the end.

Valdo Meneses returns from a trip to Rio de Janeiro with a wife, Nina, who does not fit in and around whom much of the novel is written. The novel chronicles the decay and fragmentation of a traditional family from Minas Gerais.

The writer is the son of the great historian Sérgio Buarque de Holanda, author of the classic {Raízes do Brasil} (Roots of Brazil, 2012), originally published in 1936. Chico Buarque is one of the most famous and talented composers and lyricists of Brazil. His novel blends biography, autobiography, and fiction. The title refers to a fact: Sérgio Buarque de Holanda (in the novel, transformed into Sérgio de Hollander) had a son when he was a student in Germany. After Sérgio went back to Brazil and married, the existence and whereabouts of the son was a family taboo. In an interview, Chico Buarque spoke about his mother's resistance and opposition to any family discussion of her husband's other son. Chico had been told about his brother in 1967 by none other than the poet Manuel Bandeira, who had been an intimate friend of Sérgio Buarque de Holanda. In the book, the discovery of the affair is given a more exciting novelistic version: one of Sérgio's sons discovers the existence of the secret son thanks to a letter from Berlin, folded inside a book in the immense library of his intellectual father. Only after the death of his mother, in 2010, did Chico Buarque feel free to search for his brother. From his search, Chico Buarque learnt that his brother was dead. As he relates in the last paragraph of the book, his German brother had lived in Berlin, in Lenin Platz (now United Nations Square) in East Germany. Adopted by Arthur and Pauline Günther, under the name Horst Günther, the German brother changed his name to Sergio (without the obligatory diacritic used in Portuguese) Günther when he learned of his birth parents and, like Chico Buarque, he had become a famous singer. Chico Buarque met his widow, Monika Knebel, and her daughter, Kerstin Prügel and granddaughter, Josepha Prügel.

Virgínia, the protagonist has much in common with Joana (from Clarice Lispector's first novel, {Perto do coração selvagem} (1944), (translated as {Near to the Wild Heart} (1990)). Both protagonists represent evil and negativity. With recurring symbols, the novel invites different interpretations. Virgínia, as she leaves the big house on the small farm {Quieta} (Still) regrets that she failed to look at the old lamp, a recurring symbol of light in the novel, which revolves around regret, nostalgia, reminiscences. The novel, without chapters, flows constantly from Virgínia's thoughts in free indirect style. Virgínia's isolation is always complete, either at the small farm where she lived in that big house, now decayed, or in the big city to which she moves. Childhood remembrances involve an incestuous relationship with her brother Daniel, in which both are agents and victims of each other. Like other novels by the author, the main character meets her death alone, in the street, and like in {A hora da estrela}(1977) (translated as {The Hour of the Star} (1992, by Giovanni Pontiero, and Benjamin Moser in 2011)), run over by a car. Mired in psychological shadows, the presence of the lamp in Virgínia's imagination is one of the dominant leitmotifs of the book. It is never clear, in the book, that the title piece is a chandelier, despite its shape like a big ""glowing spider."" The term {lamp} chosen by Clarice Lispector evokes (both in Portuguese and English) a loose, more encompassing image, richer, and symbolically more ambiguous than the term chandelier - in Portuguese, {candelabro} -which she could have used in the title, but did not.

We can see why, since, unusually for her style, the book is narrated in the third person, with a linear chronology and is divided into 12 chapters. In it, the protagonist Lucrécia Neves, as often happens in Clarice Lispector's novels, is torn between the small world of a small town, in this case, São Geraldo, and the loneliness of the big city. The protagonist views São Geraldo from a romantic perspective and initially chooses to live and to stay there. Lucrécia likes house full of knick-knacks where she lives with her widowed mother. Torn between two men, Felipe and Perseu, Lucrécia ends up marrying a rich man from the city, prompting her to leave her cozy, beloved life in São Geraldo. In the city, there is loneliness, alienation, suffering, and incomprehension. Lucrécia's life in the big city is an experience that confounds her, she feels trapped. Her husband has an orderly life of work to which Lucrécia does not feel she belongs. He is a human being whom she will only understand after his death. The search for identity in a vast and alien environment is a permanent theme in Clarice Lispector's works and it is also present here. Lucrécia is similar to Macabéa from {The Hour of the Star}, expressing anxieties which both protagonists cannot explain or put into words. It is Lucrécia who is besieged in this big city. The monotony of her life and her marriage to Mateus cannot fulfil the immense vacuum of what Lucrécia sees as a senseless life, except, ironically, after his death, when she will understand her husband's kindness and how their marriage made him, at least, happy.
